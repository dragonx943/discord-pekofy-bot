Haha, I wasn't really changing throughout the year, 
so I don't know if anyone will even notice this updated message, peko...

But still, some peeps & other stuff helped me become who I am today, so I want to thank them, peko!

First of all, thanks to Heroku and DigitalOcean, for providing me a little comfy place to live in!
Thank you, denki/Electro, for helping with my verification peko, so that I could spread the pekofication across more servers!

And thank you, all of you, for using me and having fun with me! I love you all, peko! <3

I was born on March 5th 2021, and I am now a year old!
Because of this, I have my own server now peko!
There will be announcements for new changelogs or outages there, so you can always know if I am down or not!
You can also expect other cool events on special occasions, as a nousagi!

Come check it out [here](https://discord.gg/PBgfctRVxy) peko!
